<h1 style="color:yellow;text-align:center;">Interest in IT</h1>
<p style="color:yellow;">I am interested in IT, as I would like to work in this essential and ever-expanding field.
I realized I wanted to work and learn more about IT when I acknowledged my curiosity in how technical 
things work.  I have always liked exploring and reassembling simple technology, like most people I value 
the way it makes everyday life simpler, and greatly appreciated that it allows for easier communication, such as connecting to family overseas.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">What brought me to study at RMIT, was the fact that they had a great reputation in the IT community. 
 What better place to study then from one that provides comprehensive range of expertise, a practical 
 approach which encourages enhanced learning and valuable skills that can be applied and will benefit 
 me in the workforce and in the future, as well as flexible and online study that combines worthwhile shared experiences.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">Whilst studying at RMIT, I hope to gather an understanding of an extensive variety of knowledge and 
important familiarity with information technology, which includes an in- depth education of all topics 
necessary and professional abilities that are required.  I expect to learn hands-on skills that will assist
 my awareness of workplace practices and enable me to work in the IT industry effectively.</p>
<h1 style="color:yellow;text-align:center;">Ideal job<h1>
<h3 style="color:yellow;">Cyber Security Consultant.</h3>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39744672?searchrequesttoken=c09ffed1-1196-4fa7-9e91-acaf798e51af&type=promoted">My dream job</a>
<p style="color:yellow;">In this job I will be responsible for maintaining the security of the company and its client's online systems and networks, as well as contributing to the growth of the business.  I additionally find it very appealing to work for a company that is renowned in the work it does, as well as the high regard it has in regards to past and present employees. </p>
<p style="color:yellow;">For this position, I will be requiring a minimum of at least three years’ experience in a relevant position, as well as different experiences within the IT, and cybersecurity fields.  Additionally, I will have to possess leadership skills and be able to adapt to different to a range of different environments.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">I possess basic IT knowledge; however, I do not come from a background in IT or have prior working experience.  Therefore, I will have to put in extra effort to learn and understand all that is involved in my subjects.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">To be successful in this career, I will first have to possess a good general knowledge of information technology, placing emphasis in security factors as a whole. I also need to expand my studies and experiences significantly to be able to cope with the high demand of the role.</p>
<h2 style="color:yellow">The results of an online Myers-Briggs test</h2>
<p style="color:yellow">INTP personality, The Architect (Truity, 2019).</p>
<h2 style="color:yellow">The results of an online learning style test</h2>
<p style="color:yellow">Tactile/kinesthetics Learner (how-to-study, 2019).</p>
<h2 style="color:yellow">The results of a Big Five Personality test</h2>
<p style="color:yellow">Openness 31%, Conscientiousness 17%, Extraversion 2%, Agreeableness 15%, Neuroticism 87.5% (Truity, 2019).</p>
<p style="color:yellow">The combined results of these tests, make me feel that I have attributes that are a little rarer and more unique when compared to the majority of the population.  My results also gave me the knowledge of my strengths and weaknesses, and areas in which I can build on and improve. They further give me the confidence that a career in IT may suit me very well.</p>
<p style="color:yellow">I believe that my logical thinking and passion for technical things can help contribute to team projects.  In the way, that I will do my best to consider all options to problem solving and new ideas.  Tactile learning means I could have more of an active approach with explaining concepts or building things from scratch.  As well as, the ability to reflect on areas that I may need assistance with in order to do a better job.</p>
<p style="color:yellow">Learning my specific personality traits assists me with seeing where I would be most valuable within a team.  Additionally, I think that all team members understanding their respective personalities, will help in the organisation of assigning the best job for everyone. Team members also have to feel that the can rely on others, so they can do their best work, which is the only way a project can archive its full potential.</p>
<h1 style="color:yellow;text-align:center;">Project idea</h1>
<p style="color:yellow;">As mentioned previously, I have passion for cyber security and how important and necessary it is in these times, also the field is in quite a high demand and I would like to contribute to being involved in a vital aspect of IT and providing security to others</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">My project will be to develop an application that includes recent news and information about the latest cyber threats for cyber security professionals. Developing an application that is directly related to cyber security, will help me learn to identify threats and how to combat them.</p>
<h2 style="color:yellow">Project: Cybersecurity news application </h2>
<p style="color:yellow;">This project will be about developing an application to keep cyber security professionals informed about the latest threats and information, and news about the world of cyber security in general.  There will also be in detail reviews about the newest antiviruses and malware protection, as well as a discussion forum about multiple subjects relating to security. This application can also be used by people with no particular knowledge of information technology or computers in general. As, security is an issue that should always be treated carefully, I believe this application can helpful to people and allow a peace of mind.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">I believe this project can be interesting and useful, because of the growing cyber securities threats around the world. New viruses, trojans and malwares appear every day and people need to be alerted regularly about the new threats to their systems as well as their identities. It is reported that in Australia, businesses have seen an 18% raise in security attacks from 2017 to 2018 (Hudson, 2019). Therefore, I trust that this application can make things easier for a lot of people.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">As stated before, this application has many uses, but its main purpose will be to provide users with the latest news reports and videos about new viruses, trojans and malwares, recent cyber-attacks and the newest technology to combat existing and future said attacks. After creating an account for the application there will be an easy to follow tutorial where it makes sure users don’t miss any of the information to better understand the application, as well as every other of its resources so it can be used to its fullest potential. </p>
<p style="color:yellow;">The app administrator will review and rate different anti viruses to help users identify their best needs, users will be able to create an account and customize the application the way they see fit, they will also have the option of receiving notifications so they won’t miss any recent content. Cyber security experts, as well as people in other fields can take advantage of updated information and the 24 hours newsfeed.  Furthermore, users would be able to interact with each other, comment on stories and articles, easily share news stories in different social media formats and rate the information that will be provided to them, as well as give advice and opinions on how to make the app better for everyone. Users will also be able to save content offline and download videos for later use. The application will also be adjusted to tablet view and it will enable users to use new features to its advantages such as better video quality, as well as a more user-friendly look.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">App collaborators will keep alert of the latest and most up to date advice to optimised user’s security, they will also work on guidelines for all levels of understanding, and information will be tailored to suit everyone’s needs. There will also be a store, so they can buy the newest protection as well (antiviruses, etc.), or other security software, promotional codes will also be awarded to new members for discounts at the store. Cyber security courses can also be researched and links will be provided to users with all the relevant information. </p>
<p style="color:yellow;">The MIT app inventor is one of the most well-known software development programs around, and is going to be our main source for creating this application. We will also be needing a windows pc in order to create our application, as well as an android device to test our app, we will also need to install an MIT inventor companion app on the android device (MIT app inventor, 2019).  Both our windows pc and android device will have to be connected to the same WIFI network for this method to work.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">For the creation of this application, we will have to possess a variety of skills including development, writing, programming and design. Furthermore, as mentioned before, for hardware equipment, we will be needing a windows pc as well as an android device. The development of this app could be relatively simple and straight forward with help of MIT inventor, nonetheless developers will have to keep on top of their game to fix any problems that may arise. We believe that all the materials that will be used can be acquired fairly easily, as for the skills we will have to develop our knowledge of information technology and computer science contribute to the possibility of completing this project.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">If we succeed in our project we will demonstrate that with the right skills, we could create a user friendly and at the same time professional application, that can not only be used by experts in the cyber security field, but also by people without an information technology background. keeping them informed of the latest cyber security threats, as well as other topics. I believe that this application if created in the right way, will rise above the competition and have an impact in security in today’s world.</p>
